Hello,

    I recently found your listing for a Back-End Software Developer on Dice.com. My interest is piqued.

    Your listing for a Back-End Software Developer on Dice.com recently caught my eye.

    Part of the reason why I'm interested is that you run a Python shop. Python is my favorite dynamically typed language. I'd like to continue working with it. I'd also like to get more experience with "big data". I have experience with traditional relational databases such as PostgreSQL as well as a bit of experience with Google App Engine's Datastore. Your listing mentions MongoDB, a database I'm looking into. It would be great to work with it and a decent data set. Finally, your company has a good cause. I can definitely get behind a company that seeks to make health and fitness more accessible and fun.

    I should mention what I can do for you. First, I'm a self-starter. I experiment a lot in my spare time. My website is one of my experiments; I'm preparing to try to move it to Django-nonrel and one of the NoSQL databases from Django 1.4 and MySQL. Secondly, I am not restricted to the back end. I primarily write server-side business logic, but I occasionally crank out Javascript and CSS. I'm becoming more comfortable with it with my website by writing them by hand.

    You can find some code samples at https://github.com/deathweaselx86; the full source for my website is the shiny-website repository. Thank you for your time.
